# DICOM Standard Parser

This repository contains code that parses the DICOM standard into JSON files.

# Setup

You will need the following system level dependencies:

- Python 3.5.x
- Make + Unix tools

You will probably also want to setup a "virtual environment" (e.g. using Conda, or Pyenv + Virtualenv) to install the project dependencies into.  Once you are in your "virtual environment", you can run:

    make

to install and compile everything.
